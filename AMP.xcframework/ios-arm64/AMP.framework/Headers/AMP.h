//  This is the umbrella header and includes ObjectiveC headers that can be referenced by the Swift code.
//  This file needs to be named the same as the module name and cannot be the same name as any of the
//  Swift classes.  That is why "AMP" is used as the module name and "Amp" is the class name.
